2. Internal Record Format
- Show your record format design and describe how your design satisfies O(1) field access. If not, just mention that you haven't implemented this feature.

We divided each record into these parts:
{Number of Attributes, Null Indicators, Directory of offsets for closing off each attribute, Attribute values}
O(1) reads are achieved because the system knows where each field ends, so every lookup operation knowing the order of attributes can jump
straight to the record offset.

- Describe how you store a VarChar field.
First 4 bytes are read as Int n to determine the length of the varchar field.
The following n bytes are extracted and appended onto the record.
After the record forming completes, it seeks the final page or the first page with enough space and stores it.
